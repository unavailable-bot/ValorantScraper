# ValorantScraper

 ---------> current ver[https://github.com/unavailable-bot/ValorantScraper/releases/tag/1.0.1]

This tool is perfect for anyone who wants to create a clean and appealing description of their Valorant account — or even multiple accounts. Just input your list of skins, agents, and all other valuable info (like rank, gun buddies, region, etc.) and hit generate 🛠️.

The tool will visually display all your skins in one window so you can take a screenshot 📸. Then it does the same with agents. At the end, you can optionally insert an Imgur link where you uploaded your screenshots — or leave it blank.

Finally, you’ll get a ready-to-use template copied to your clipboard 📋. Just hit Ctrl+V into your text field and you're done.

This software was originally made for personal use and later released as part of a portfolio — maybe it'll come in handy for someone else too! 😄
